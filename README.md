# 🔐 Password-Manager-App
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my password manager project. I built this in my quest to improve my python basically programming skills

# 🚀 Features

Store Passwords: Chuck in your website, email, and password. Easy peasy!
Generate Passwords: Can't think of a good password? No worries! Hit the "Generate Password" button and boom! You've got a strong one.
Copy to Clipboard: Generated passwords automatically copy to your clipboard. Neat, right?
Simple UI: Nothing fancy, just the stuff you need.

# 🛠️How It Works
Enter Details: Type in the website and your email/username.
Generate Password: Click the "Generate Password" button if you want a random, strong password.
Save: Hit "Add" and your details are saved in a txt file. Simple as that!

# 🔧Setup
Make sure you've got Python installed.
Install the required packages:
Copypip install pyperclip
Download the logo.png file (or use your own and update the code).
Run the script:
Copypython password_manager.py

# 📝 Note
This is a pretty basic setup, so don't go storing your bank details or anything super secret in here! It's more of a learning project and a handy tool for remembering those not-so-important passwords.

# 🚧 Future Ideas
Encrypt the password file (because why not add some extra security?)
Add a search function (for when the list gets looong)
Maybe a cool dark mode? 😎

Feel free to tinker with the code, break stuff, fix stuff, or add your own cool features. That's the fun of coding, right?
